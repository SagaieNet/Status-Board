# Status Board

## Ideas

Here are the ideas for the status board script.

1. Self Hosted and open source
2. Simple and Elegant code
3. Modular and easy to add new status widgets.

## Widget Ideas

* [] Basecamp
* [] Analytics (Google?)
* [x] Twitter
* [] RSS / News Feeds
* [] Bus / Train / Traffic status
* [] Radio - Spotify, Grooveshark, etc. Would play based off api.
* [x] Github Commit Logs
* [x] Github issues
* [] BitBucket API
* [] Pancake Payments

Basically anything that you always want to look at during the day.

## Installation

Currently installation is pretty easy. Upload the files and visit yoursite.com/index.php and all the active widgets should load in. To manage the widgets you can edit the application/views/home/index.php and change the values.

I decided to use html data attributes for the first release just to keep it simple. Future versions will probably include some form of storage and better ways of inserting the widget settings.

Remember this is alpha code so use at your own risk.

## Help Out

If you are interested in helping out let me know. The more help the better ;) I haven't figured the best route for
project planning so if you have any ideas on the best way let me know. When I mentioned this idea over twitter I did
get a lot of positive feedback so I feel this project is worth pursuing.

Also until I get everything planned consider [subscribing to a newsletter](http://eepurl.com/hzTZE). I am planning to
use that so I can contact everyone to schedule a time and place for v1 planning.
